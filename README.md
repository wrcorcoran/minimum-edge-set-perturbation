# Minimum Edge Set Perturbation Problem (MESP)

Currently, there are three main research heuristics:
- Homophily
- Degree
- Common Neighbors

See their findings here:
- [Homophily](https://github.com/wrcorcoran/minimum-edge-set-perturbation/blob/main/homophily/experiments/FINDINGS.md)
- [Degree](https://github.com/wrcorcoran/minimum-edge-set-perturbation/blob/main/degree/experiments/FINDINGS.md)
- [Common Neighbors](https://github.com/wrcorcoran/minimum-edge-set-perturbation/blob/main/common-neighbors/experiments/FINDINGS.md)
